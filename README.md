This is a general purpose python notebook to work with the isoclassify package to extract stellar parameters using photometry stored in a table in the FITS file format. As the user, you just have to specify the filepaths on your system (corresponding to the location of your files and installations) and the names of the columns in your FITS file. Follow the comments starting with USER. Generally, users will just have to modify cell 1.1 and run subsequent cells as is.

Pre-Requisite: Installation of Isoclassify from https://github.com/danxhuber/isoclassify

Note: The program will NOT crash if your data has NaN values.
